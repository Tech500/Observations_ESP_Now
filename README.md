# Observations_ESP_Now
ESP-Now project with three nodes and including a webserver, BME280 sensor, and a relay.

This a project in the works and is not fully functional.   BME280 sensor readings are being sent successfullyfrom board_1; boar_2 (web server) is not receiving BME280 redings.  Web server is receiving relay readings from board_3 are successfully sent.

Purpose of project is to have an outdoor, battery powered, BME280 environmental sensor; which will connect to an in house web server.  One of the web server features is an outdoor, Wyze camera providing a videofeed of current weather conditions.  Goal is to control the camera battery power via the web server to an outdoor relay.  Presently a 10,000 mAH power bank requires daily, battery swapping.
